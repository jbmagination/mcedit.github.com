A demo of technologies used in MCEdit 2.0 is available for download from the links to the left.

Note that this is a very early version of the software. There are bugs everywhere and most of the important features are missing. <em>Do not use this version for any serious work.</em> Don't bother reporting any bugs either, I already know about them. <small>(Actually, you can report if the app doesn't even open, as long as you attach your `mcedit.log` file in a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com) or something)</small>
