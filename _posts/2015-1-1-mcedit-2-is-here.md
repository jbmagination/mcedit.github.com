MCEdit 2.0 has been in development for what seems like a year, and it is now ready for public testing. Use the
download links to the left to choose the correct edition for your computer.

While in Alpha, I am only interested in bug reports where MCEdit completely fails to start. Open an issue using the
"Report Issues" link to the left and always attach your `mcedit.log` file from the MCEdit folder.

MCEdit has been almost completely rewritten, and now sports a conventional UI made using the Qt toolkit. Here are
some new features you might like.

- Instant undo/redo - no waiting for a copy before every edit.
- Shaped selections - combine selections by adding and subtracting shapes
- Lighting updated immediately - instead of all at once when you save
- Resource pack support - textures, block models, and items
- Block model support - future blocks will now display correctly (Requires MC 1.7+)
- Textures and models from your Minecraft installation (Requires MC 1.7+)
- Generate tool - generate structures and objects with live preview (will be extendable with plugins!)
- New plugin system - replaces the old "filter" system with several new types of plugin (WIP)
