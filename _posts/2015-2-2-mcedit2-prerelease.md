As a reward for my twitter followers, an early alpha version of MCEdit 2.0 is now available from the links to the left. 

Many key features are now here, but in a very rough state. Lots of things are slow and still don't work right. As before, <em>Do not use this version for any serious work!</em> Don't bother reporting any bugs, except for when MCEdit crashes on startup or doesn't even open - and remember to post your `mcedit.log` file.
  
Only for 64-bit Windows, because resource limits aren't in yet and it will just run out of memory on 32-bit.
