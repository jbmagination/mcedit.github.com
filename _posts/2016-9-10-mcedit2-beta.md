Since most of the vital features have been implemented, MCEdit 2 
has now entered the Beta stage of development. Feel free to report 
issues of any kind. 

Downloads for Mac OS X are now available. Mac OS X experts are welcome
to make or suggest any Mac-specific improvements.

Documentation for plugin authors is underway and can be found at the

MCEdit's knowledge of blocks and block types has also been updated for
Minecraft 1.10.
